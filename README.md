## Note:
To compile your own version of this app you would need to add firebase configuration files to the project.
For android this is the `google-services.json` file and for iOS this is the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
You can get these files by creating a firebase project and adding android and/or iOS apps to the project.
Make sure to enable Firestore in the firebase console. The project depends on Firebase Core, Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase authentication.
